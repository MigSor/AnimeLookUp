# AnimeLookUp

AnimeLookUp is a web-based application that allows users to search for information about their favorite anime series. This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with data fetched from the Jikan API. AnimeLookUp provides users with an easy way to access details about various anime series, including titles, images, synopses, genres, and more.

## Features

- **Anime Search:** Users can search for anime by entering the title in the search bar and clicking "Submit." The application fetches data from the Jikan API and displays the results on the webpage.

- **Safe for Work Filter:** AnimeLookUp offers a "Safe for Work" option that filters out potentially sensitive content, providing a family-friendly browsing experience.

- **Detailed Information:** Users can click on an anime card to access additional information about the series, such as the synopsis, genre, and release date.

- **Search by Favorite:** Users can choose this option after they have clicked the like button on the additional information, they can populate the list by choosing the favorite anime in the select option.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The project's structure and layout were created using HTML.

- **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets were used for styling and ensuring a visually appealing user interface.

- **JavaScript:** The application's interactivity and dynamic content loading were achieved using JavaScript. Event listeners were implemented to enhance the user experience.

- **Jikan API:** The Jikan API, an unofficial MyAnimeList API, was used to fetch extensive anime-related data, including details about episodes, characters, and more.
